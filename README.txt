WHY USE THIS GARBAGE?
--------------------------
It cuts back on CPU usage, so you can watch at higher qualities on older computers (or watch it at all). Instead of using the heavy flash or HTML5 player, it uses your prefered video playback software!
It handles buffering a lot better (it won't stop randomly and annoyingly like the browser does, it just skips a few frames).
Better quality? Lower internet usage? Placebo? You tell me.
It removes Twitch ads, you should oficially support twitch! @ www.twitch.tv

REQUISITES
--------------------------
Media Player Classic (K-LITE Codec Pack) is recommended.
You can use VLC and other players, it'll be explained below.
Google Chrome. (If you really want firefox contact me @ the email below).

INSTALLATION
--------------------------
1. Install livestreamer-v1.12.2-win32-setup.exe
2. Go to %AppData%\Roaming\livestreamer
3. Open livestreamerrc (with notepad++ or something)
4. Add these lines anywhere:
	player="D:\Program Files\K-Lite Codec Pack\MPC-HC64\mpc-hc64.exe" #IMPORTANT - especify WHERE the player is in your system! Otherwise it won't work, this is just an example.
	http-header=Client-ID=jzkbprff40iqj646a697cyrvl0zt2m6
4.1. If you're not using MPC, you can read the livestreamerrc file and use another player, by changing the player="###" into your player of choice. (Only a few work, again I recommended the K-Lite codec media pack).
5. Now open Streamer.exe and have fun!
6. If there's any problems, contact pessegueiro@iol.pt

OBSERVATIONS
--------------------------
1. If you feel like your stream is delayed, just use the STOP function of the player and resume.
2. Don't close Streamer.exe after opening the player, otherwise it'll stop the stream.
3. After closing the player, Streamer.exe will close automaticly and free some resources, don't force close it too.
4. If you have a really old computer, don't enable chat.
